## 🗺️ Shifter App - A Commuter's Friend

This is a personal project of mine that made me fall in love with coding. It all started with an idea based on a real-life experience.

As a typical employee in the Philippines, I often commute to work, and there have been times when I missed my stop on the way home because I fell asleep on the bus due to work fatigue. I know I'm not the only one facing this issue.

So I designed and built this app for my fellow commuters.

**Main Features:**

* 📍 Easy to Use & Accurate ETAs: Get real-time updates on arrival times with just a few taps, so you, as a commuter, always know when to expect your destination. Plus, our app's ETA and alarm schedule adjust seamlessly with traffic conditions.

* ⏰ Set a 5-Minute Alarm Before Your ETA: With Shifter App, it automatically sets a 5-minute alarm before your ETA, ensuring you never miss your destination again, even when traffic is unpredictable. Relax, read, or catch up on emails - we'll alert you in time!
